        <h1>various Hair Techniques</h1>
<p>There are a variety of hair cutting techniques to choose from to create different hairstyles. Every hairstyle has a specific cutting technique to achieve it; and by changing the cutting technique, we can create varied styles. Here’s a lowdown on the most common hair cutting techniques…

<p>Scissor And Clip Over Comb:
This hair cutting technique uses the comb as a guide to cut areas where the hair is too short for a finger guide. Normally used around the ears or nape region.
Club Cutting:
Referred to as ‘blunt’ cutting, the section of hair to be cut is held out from the head and cut off at the tips.</p>
<h2>Thinning</h2>
<p>Hair is thinned out with scissors or a razor to increase volume at the root, or soften a new hairstyle</p>.
<h1>Freehand</h3>
<p>For this hair cutting technique, the stylist uses the scissors to cut the hair without holding it – either in the other hand or through the use of any other tool to keep the hair in place. Here, cutting is generally done with the scissors pointed down at an angle, though it can be cut upward too.</p>
<h4>Graduating</h4>
<p>This hair cutting technique involves using the length of the outside line as a guide, where the hair is held away from the head, cutting away the bulk from the outside line.</p>
<h5>Curl Cutting</h5>
In this method, the hair is first washed and conditioned, then cut wet. Instead of horizontally, the hair is cut vertically – creating volume and air in the curls.
<h6>Texturising</h6>
<p>This hair cutting technique comprises cutting the hair in different lengths to achieve varied styles. Long hair can be made to look less uniform, short hair can be texturised to create a spiked look.</p>
